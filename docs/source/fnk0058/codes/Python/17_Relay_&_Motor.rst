Component Knowledge
=========================

Relay
--------------------------

A relay is a safe switch, which can use low power circuit to control high power circuit. It consists of electromagnet and contacts. The electromagnet is controlled by low power circuit and contacts are used in high power circuit. When the electromagnet is energized, it will attract contacts.

The following is a schematic diagram of a common relay and the feature and circuit symbol of a 5V relay used in this project:

.. list-table::
   :width: 100%
   :align: center
   
   * -  Diagram

     -  Symbol

     -  |Chapter17_13|
     -  |Chapter17_14|
    
.. |Chapter17_12| image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_12.png
.. |Chapter17_13| image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_13.png
.. |Chapter17_14| image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_14.png

Pin 5 and pin 6 are connected to each other inside. When the coil pins 3 and 4 are connected to 5V power supply, pin 1 will be disconnected to pin 5&6 and pin 2 will be connected to pin 5&6. So pin 1 is called close end, pin 2 is called open end.

Inductor
--------------------------

The symbol of Inductance is "L" and the unit of inductance is the "Henry" (H). Here is an example of how this can be encountered: 1H=1000mH, 1mH=1000μH.

An inductor is an energy storage device that converts electrical energy into magnetic energy. Generally, it consists of winding coil, with a certain amount of inductance. Inductors hinder the change of current passing through it.  When the current passing through it increases, it will attempt to hinder the increasing trend of current; and when the current passing through it decreases, it will attempt to hinder the decreasing trend of current. Therefore, the current passing through inductor is not transient.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_15.png
    :align: center

The reference circuit for relay is as follows. The coil of relays can be equivalent to that of inductors, when the transistor disconnects power supply of the relay, the current in the coil of the relay cannot stop immediately, causing an impact on power supply. Therefore, a parallel diode will be connected to both ends of relay coil pin in reversing direction, and then the current will pass through diode, avoiding the impact on power supply. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_16.png
    :align: center

Motor
----------------------------

A motor is a device that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Motor consists of two parts: stator and rotor. When motor works, the stationary part is stator, and the rotating part is rotor. Stator is usually the outer case of motor, and it has terminals to connect to the power. Rotor is usually the shaft of motor, and can drive other mechanical devices to run. Diagram below is a small DC motor with two pins.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_17.png
    :align: center

When a motor is connected to the power supply, it will rotate in one direction. Reverse the polarity of power supply, then the motor rotates in opposite direction.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_18.png
    :align: center

Breadboard Power
---------------------------

When the Raspberry Pi Pico outputs insufficient power or the power supply voltage and power consumption required by the device or module exceeds that provided by the Raspberry Pi Pico, you can choose Breadboard Power to either output 3.3V voltage source or 5V voltage source. Input power: DC 6~10V power supply or USB power supply.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_19.png
    :align: center

Usage:

First connect Breadboard Power to the power supply, and then selectively choose the connection between OFF and 5V, 3V to generate different voltage source outputs, as the picture shows.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/17_Relay_&_Motor/Chapter17_20.png
    :align: center

You can either select only one side of the output power supply, or choose to output 5V or 3.3V power supply at the same time on both sides, because the output circuits on both sides are separated and controlled independently and will not cause interference. Note that the GND should be connected to any GND of the Raspberry Pi Pico to form a Common ground connection.

Code 
============================

Use buttons to control the relays and motors.

Open "Thonny", click "This computer" -> "D:" -> "Micropython_Codes" -> "17.1_Relay_And_Motor" and double click "17.1_Relay_And_Motor.py". 

Relay_And_Motor
--------------------------------

Click "Run current script". When the DC Motor is connected to a power supply, it will rotate in one direction. If you reverse the polarity of the power supply, the DC Motor will rotate in opposite direction. Press Ctrl+C or click "Stop/Restart backend" to exit the program.
