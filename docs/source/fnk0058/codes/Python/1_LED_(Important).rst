.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_25.png
    :align: center

Make sure Raspberry Pi Pico has been connected with the computer. Click "Stop/Restart backend", and then wait to see what interface will show up.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_26.png
    :align: center

Click "Run current script" shown in the box above, the code starts to be executed and the LED in the circuit starts to blink. Press Ctrl+C or click "Stop/Restart backend" to exit the program.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_27.png
    :align: center

.. note::

    This is the code :ref:`running online<online>`. If you disconnect USB cable and repower Raspberry Pi Pico, LED stops blinking and the following messages will display in Thonny.

Uploading code to Raspberry Pi Pico
-----------------------------------------

As shown in the following illustration, right-click the file 01.1_Blink.py and select "Upload to /" to upload code to Raspberry Pi Pico.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_28.png
    :align: center

Upload main.py in the same way. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_29.png
    :align: center

Disconnect Raspberry Pi Pico USB cable and reconnect it, LED on Pico will blink repeatedly. 

.. note::
    
    Codes here is run offline. If you want to stop running offline and enter Shell, just click "Stop" in Thonny.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_30.png
    :align: center

:red:`If you have any concerns, please contact us via:` support@freenove.com

The following is the program code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Python/Python_Codes/01.1_Blink/01.1_Blink.py
    :linenos: 
    :language: python
    :dedent:

Each time a new file is opened, the program will be executed from top to bottom. When encountering a loop construction, it will execute the loop statement according to the loop condition.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_31.png
    :align: center

Print() function is used to print data to Terminal. It can be executed in Terminal directly or be written in a Python file and executed by running the file.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    print("Hello world!")

Each time when using the functions of Raspberry Pi Pico, you need to import modules corresponding to those functions: Import time module and Pin module of machine module.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import time
    from machine import Pin

:red:`Configure GP25 of Raspberry Pi Pico to output mode and assign it to an object named "led". `

:red:`Configure "LED" of Raspberry Pi Pico W to output mode and assign it to an object named "led".`

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)     #Pico 
    #led = Pin("LED", Pin.OUT) #Pico W

It means that from now on, LED representing GP25 is in output mode.

Set the value of LED to 1 and GP25 will output high level.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    led.value(1) #Set led turn on

Set the value of LED to 0 and led pin will output low level.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    led.value(0) #Set led turn on

Execute codes in a while loop.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    while True:
        ...

Put statements that may cause an error in "try" block and the executing statements when an error occurs in "except" block. In general, when the program executes statements, it will execute those in "try" block. However, when an error occurs to Raspberry Pi Pico due to some interference or other reasons, it will execute statements in "except" block.

"Pass" is an empty statement. When it is executed, nothing happens. It is useful as a placeholder to make the structure of a program look better. 

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    try:
        ...
    except:
        pass

The single-line comment of Micropython starts with a "#" and continues to the end of the line. Comments help us to understand code. When programs are running, Thonny will skip comments.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    
    #Set led turn on

MicroPython uses indentations to distinguish different blocks of code instead of braces. The number of indentations is changeable, but it must be consistent throughout one block. If the indentation of the same code block is inconsistent, it will cause errors when the program runs.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    while True:
        led.value(1)    #Set led turn on
        time.sleep(0.5) #Sleep 0.5s
        led.value(0)    #Set led turn off
        time.sleep(0.5) #Sleep 0.5s

How to import python files
------------------------------------

If you import the module directly, you should indicate the module to which the function or attribute belongs when using the function or attribute (constant, variable) in the module. The format should be <module name>.<function or attribute>, otherwise, an error will occur. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_32.png
    :align: center

If you only want to import a certain function or attribute in the module, use the "from...import" statement. The format is as follows

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_33.png
    :align: center

When using "from...import" statement to import function, to avoid conflicts and for easy understanding, you can use "as" statement to rename the imported function, as follows

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_34.png
    :align: center

Component Knowledge
==============================

LED
-------------------------------

An LED is a type of diode. All diodes only work if current is flowing in the correct direction and have two Poles.  An LED will only work (light up) if the longer pin (+) of LED is connected to the positive output from a power source and the shorter pin is connected to the negative (-). Negative output is also referred to as Ground (GND). This type of component is known as "Polar" (think One-Way Street).

All common two-lead diodes are the same in this respect. Diodes work only if the voltage of its positive electrode is higher than its negative electrode and there is a narrow range of operating voltage for most all common diodes of 1.9 and 3.4V. If you use much more than 3.3V the LED will be damaged and burn out.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_14.png
    :align: center

.. note::
    
    LEDs cannot be directly connected to a power supply, which usually ends in a damaged component. A resistor with a specified resistance value must be connected in series to the LED you plan to use.

Resistor
-------------------------------

Resistors use Ohms (Ω) as the unit of measurement of their resistance (R). 1MΩ=1000kΩ, 1kΩ=1000Ω. 

A resistor is a passive electrical component that limits or regulates the flow of current in an electronic circuit. 

On the left, we see a physical representation of a resistor, and the right is the symbol used to represent the presence of a resistor in a circuit diagram or schematic.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_15.png
    :align: center

The bands of color on a resistor is a shorthand code used to identify its resistance value. For more details of resistor color codes, please refer to the appendix of this tutorial.

With a fixed voltage, there will be less current output with greater resistance added to the circuit. The relationship between Current, Voltage and Resistance can be expressed by this formula: I=V/R known as Ohm's Law where I = Current, V = Voltage and R = Resistance. Knowing the values of any two of these allows you to solve the value of the third.

In the following diagram, the current through R1 is: I=U/R=5V/10kΩ=0.0005A=0.5mA. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_16.png
    :align: center

WARNING: Never connect the two poles of a power supply with anything of low resistance value (i.e. a metal object or bare wire) this is a Short and results in high current that may damage the power supply and electronic components.

.. note::
    
    Unlike LEDs and Diodes, Resistors have no poles and re non-polar (it does not matter which direction you insert them into a circuit, it will work the same)

Breadboard
--------------------------

Here we have a small breadboard as an example of how the rows of holes (sockets) are electrically attached. 

The left picture shows the way to connect pins. The right picture shows the practical internal structure.

Power
--------------------------

In this tutorial, we connect Raspberry Pi Pico and computer with a USB cable.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/1_LED/Chapter01_18.png
    :align: center

Circuit
==========================

First, disconnect all power from the Raspberry Pi Pico. Then build the circuit according to the circuit and hardware diagrams. After the circuit is built and verified correct, connect the PC to Raspberry Pi Pico. 

CAUTION: Avoid any possible short circuits (especially connecting 3.3V and GND)! 

WARNING: A short circuit can cause high current in your circuit, create excessive component heat and cause permanent damage to your hardware!
