Chapter Bluetooth (Only for Pico W)
##############################################################################

In June 2023, Raspberry Pi Official has updated to add Bluetooth support to the Pico W.

Pico W's Bluetooth 5.2 supports Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality. At the beginning of this chapter, we will learn the Pico W's Bluetooth function.

If you have Pico in your hand, please change it to Pico W before continuing to learn.

Component knowledge
==============================

Pico W's wireless functionality is provided by the Infineon CYW43439 device, which contains a 2.4 GHz radio providing both 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.2, supporting Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality.

For simple data transfer, there are two modes:

Master mode
-----------------------------

A device works in master mode can connect to one or more slave devices.

We can search and select the slave devices nearby to connect.

When a device initiates a connection request in master mode, it requires information about other Bluetooth devices, including their addresses and pairing keys.

Once the devices are paired, a direct connection can be established.

Slave mode
-----------------------------

A Bluetooth module operating in slave mode can only receive connection requests from a master device and cannot actively initiate connections.

After establishing a connection with a master device, it can either send or receive data.

Bluetooth devices can interact with each other, with one in master mode and the other in slave mode.

During data communication, the master device searches for and selects nearby devices to connect with.

Once a connection is made, data can be exchanged between the devices.

In the case of data exchange between a smartphone and a Raspberry Pi Pico W, the smartphone typically operates in master mode, while the Raspberry Pi Pico W functions in slave mode.

Circuit
===========================

Connect Pico W to the computer using the USB cable.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/30_WiFi_Working_Modes_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter30_01.png
    :align: center

Code
===========================

Move the program folder " **Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi_Pico/Python/Python_Codes** " to disk(D) in advance with the path of "D:/Micropython_Codes".

Open "Thonny", click "This computer" -> "D:" -> "Micropython_Codes" -> "32.1_BLE". Right click "ble_advertising.py" and select "Upload to /" to upload it to Pico W. Then, double click "ble.py" to open the file.

32.1_BLE
---------------------------

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_38.png
    :align: center

Click the Run button to run BLE.py.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_39.png

Turn ON Bluetooth on your phone and open LightBlue APP.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_40.png
    :align: center

At the device scan page, scroll down to refresh the devices nearby. Select PicoW_BLE to connect.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_41.png

Once the Bluetooth connects successfully, it will print the messages as shown below.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_42.png
    :align: center

Click "Receive". Select the corresponding data format in the box on the right side of the data format, such as HEX hexadecimal, utf-string string, Binary, etc. Then click SUBSCRIBE.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_43.png

You can type "Hello" in Shell and press "Enter" to send. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_44.png
    :align: center

Then you can see the mobile Bluetooth has received the message.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_44.png
    :align: center

Similarly, you can select "Send" on your phone. Set Data format, and then enter anything in the sending box and click Write to send.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_45.png

    :lines: 32-32
    :dedent:

When the smartphone sends data to the Pico W via BLE Bluetooth, convert the data to utf-8 format and remove the trailing '\r\n', then print it out via the serial port. When the Pico W receives data from the serial port, it sends the data back to the smartphone via BLE Bluetooth.
