In this chapter, we will learn about Thermistors that are another kind of Resistor.

Project Thermometer
***********************************

A Thermistor is a type of Resistor whose resistance value is dependent on temperature and changes in temperature. Therefore, we can take advantage of this characteristic to make a thermometer.

Thermistor
----------------------------

A Thermistor is a temperature sensitive resistor. When it senses a change in temperature, the resistance of the Thermistor will change. We can take advantage of this characteristic by using a Thermistor to detect temperature intensity. A Thermistor and its electronic symbol are shown below.

The relationship between resistance value and temperature of a thermistor is:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/12_Thermistor/Chapter12_02.png
    :align: center

**Where:**
    
        Rt is the thermistor resistance under T2 temperature;
        
        **R** is the nominal resistance of thermistor under T1 temperature;
        
        **EXP[n]** is nth power of e;
        
        **B** is for thermal index;
        
        T1, T2 is Kelvin temperature (absolute temperature). Kelvin temperature=273.15 + Celsius temperature. 
    
    For the parameters of the Thermistor, we use: B=3950, R=10kΩ, T1=25℃.
    
    The circuit connection method of the Thermistor is similar to photoresistor, as the following:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/12_Thermistor/Chapter12_03.png
    :align: center

We can use the value measured by the ADC converter to obtain the resistance value of Thermistor, and then we can use the formula to obtain the temperature value.

Therefore, the temperature formula can be derived as:

Circuit
=============================

The circuit of this project is similar to the one in the previous chapter. The only difference is that the Photoresistor is replaced by a Thermistor.

Code
===========================

Open "Thonny", click "This computer" -> "D:" -> "Micropython_Codes" -> "12.1_Thermometer" and double click "12.1_Thermometer.py".

Click "Run current script" and "Shell" will constantly display the current ADC value, voltage value and temperature value. Try to "pinch" the thermistor (without touching the leads) with your index finger and thumb for a brief time, you should see that the temperature value increases. Press Ctrl+C or click "Stop/Restart backend" to exit the program.

The following is the code:

    :linenos: 
    :language: python
    :dedent:

read_u16() function is called to read the value of ADC0. 

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Python/Python_Codes/11.1_Photoresistor/11.1_Photoresistor.py
    :linenos: 
    :language: python

    :dedent:

Convert the read ADC0 value to get the current Thermistor voltage value.

The current Thermistor resistance (Rt) is calculated by Ohm's law.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Python/Python_Codes/11.1_Photoresistor/11.1_Photoresistor.py
    :linenos: 
    :language: python
    :lines: 12-12
    :dedent:

According to the formula: T2=1/(1/T1+ln(Rt/R)/B), where T1 = 25℃, R = 10KΩ, B = 3950 and the Rt calculated in the previous step, substitute the formula to calculate tempK(T2) . Get the value of the temperature unit K.

    :lines: 13-13
    :dedent:

Finally, tempK (unit: K) is converted to tempC (unit: °C). You can also convert to Fahrenheit based on your needs.
