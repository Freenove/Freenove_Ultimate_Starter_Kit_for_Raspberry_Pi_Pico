Chapter 74HC595 & LED Bar Graph
##############################################################################

We have used LED Bar Graph to make a flowing water light, in which 10 GPIO ports of Raspberry Pi Pico is occupied. More GPIO ports mean that more peripherals can be connected to Raspberry Pi Pico, so GPIO resource is very precious. Can we make flowing water light with less GPIO? In this chapter, we will learn a component, 74HC595, which can achieve the target.

Project 14.1 Flowing Water Light
*************************************

Now let us learn how to use the 74HC595 IC Chip to make a flowing water light using less GPIO.

74HC595
---------------------------------

A 74HC595 chip is used to convert serial data into parallel data. A 74HC595 chip can convert the serial data of one byte into 8 bits, and send its corresponding level to each of the eight ports correspondingly. With this characteristic, the 74HC595 chip can be used to expand the IO ports of Raspberry Pi Pico. At least three ports are required to control the eight ports of the 74HC595 chip.

Code
========================

In this project, we will make a flowing water light with a 74HC595 chip to learn about its functions.

Open "Thonny", click "This computer" -> "D:" -> "Micropython_Codes" -> "14.1_Flowing_Water_Light". Select "my74HC595.py", right click your mouse to select "Upload to /", wait for "my74HC595.py"to be uploaded to Raspberry Pi Pico and then double click "14.1_Flowing_Water_Light.py".

Click"Run current script" and you will see that Bar Graph LED starts with the flowing water pattern blinking from left to right and then back from right to left. If it displays nothing, maybe the LED Bar is connected upside down, please unplug it and then re-plug it reversely. Press Ctrl+C or click "Stop/Restart backend" to exit the program.

    Before each use of the object **Chip74HC595** , make sure my74HC595.py has been uploaded to "/" of Raspberry Pi Pico, and then add the statement "from my74HC595 import Chip74HC595" to the top of the python file. 
    
    **Chip74HC595():** An object. By default, 74HC595's DS pin is connected to GP18 of Raspberry Pi Pico, ST_CP pin is connected to Raspberry Pi Pico GP20, SH_CP pin is connected to Raspberry Pi Pico GP21, OE pin is connected to Raspberry Pi Pico GP19. If you need to modify the pins, just do the following operations.
    
    **chip=Chip74HC595()** or **chip=Chip74HC595(18, 20, 21, 19).**
    
    **shiftOut(direction, data):** Write data to 74HC595. 
    
        **direction:** When direction=1, it indicates data is sent from the highest byte to the lowest byte (left to right) in turn; direction=0 indicates data is sent from the lowest byte to the highest byte (right to left) in turn.
    
        **data:** The content that is sent, which is one-byte data.
    
    **clear():** Clear the latch data of 74HC595.
