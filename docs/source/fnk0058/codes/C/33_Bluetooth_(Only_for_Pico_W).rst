Chapter Bluetooth (Only for Pico W)
##############################################################################

In June 2023, Raspberry Pi Official has updated to add Bluetooth support to the Pico W.

Pico W's Bluetooth 5.2 supports Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality. At the beginning of this chapter, we will learn the Pico W's Bluetooth function.

If you have Pico in your hand, please change it to Pico W before continuing to learn.

Component knowledge
==============================

Pico W's wireless functionality is provided by the Infineon CYW43439 device, which contains a 2.4 GHz radio providing both 802.11n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.2, supporting Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) functionality.

For simple data transfer, there are two modes:

Master mode
-----------------------------

A device works in master mode can connect to one or more slave devices.

We can search and select the slave devices nearby to connect.

When a device initiates a connection request in master mode, it requires information about other Bluetooth devices, including their addresses and pairing keys.

Once the devices are paired, a direct connection can be established.

Slave mode
-----------------------------

A Bluetooth module operating in slave mode can only receive connection requests from a master device and cannot actively initiate connections.

After establishing a connection with a master device, it can either send or receive data.

Bluetooth devices can interact with each other, with one in master mode and the other in slave mode.

During data communication, the master device searches for and selects nearby devices to connect with.

Once a connection is made, data can be exchanged between the devices.

In the case of data exchange between a smartphone and a Raspberry Pi Pico W, the smartphone typically operates in master mode, while the Raspberry Pi Pico W functions in slave mode.

    **SetName(const char *name):** Sets the Bluetooth module name.
    
    **begin():** Initializes the Bluetooth functionality.
    
    **available():** Retrieves data sent from the buffer; if none, returns 0.
    
    **read():** Reads data from Bluetooth, returns data as an int type.
    
    **readString():** Reads data from Bluetooth, returns data as a String type.
    
    **write(uint8_t c):** Sends a single uint8_t type of data to Bluetooth.

Step 2. Open Serial Monitor.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_17.png
    :align: center

Step 3. Set the baud rate to 115200.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/33_Bluetooth_(Only_for_Pico_W)/Chapter33_18.png
    :align: center

Turn ON Bluetooth on your phone and open LightBlue App.

Reference
--------------------------------

The 'trim()' function is used to remove whitespace from both sides of a string, converting "led_on\n" to "led_on" for easier subsequent judgment.

.. py:function:: void String: :trim(void)	

    removes whitespace from both sides of a string.

The 'equals()' function is used to compare if two strings are identical, providing a simple and fast way to compare strings.

.. py:function:: unsigned char String: :equals(const String &s2)	

    s2: The other string to be compared.

    Return value: 
    
    If s2 is not equal to the current string, the return value is 0.

    If s2 is equal to the current string, the return value is 1.

    .. note::
        
        Both data being compared must be of string type.
