We have learned how to control 2D and 3D figures. Now, we will use Raspberry Pi Pico to play the classic snake game. There are both 2D and 3D versions.

Project 3.1 Snake Game
***********************************

First, let's play a 2D snake game.

.. note::
    
    :red:`To help users have a better experience when doing the projects, we have made some modifications to Picoâ€™s simulation diagram. Please note that there are certain differences between the simulation diagram and the actual board to avoid misunderstanding. Thanks for your support to our product.`

Sketch
==========================

Sketch Snake_Game
---------------------------

Use Processing to open Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi_Pico\\Processing\\

Processing\\Snake_Game\\Snake_Game.pde and click Run. 

If the connection succeeds, it will show as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/3_Snake_Game/Chapter03_02.png
    :align: center

Press the space bar on keyboard to start the game:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/3_Snake_Game/Chapter03_03.png
    :align: center

Shift the joystick to control the snake's action. The game rules are the same as the classic snake game:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/3_Snake_Game/Chapter03_04.png
    :align: center

When the game fails, press space bar to restart the game:

    :align: center

Additionally, you can restart the game by pressing the space bar at any time.

Project 3.2 Snake Game 3D
*************************************

Now, let's experience the 3D version game.

Component List

---------------------------------------

Use Processing to open **Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi_Pico\\Processing\\**

**Processing\\Snake_Game_3D\\Snake_Game_3D.pde** and click Run. 

If the connection succeeds, it will show as follows:

Press the space bar on keyboard to start the game:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/3_Snake_Game/Chapter03_07.png
    :align: center

Shift the joystick to control the snake's action. The game rules are the same as the classic snake game:
