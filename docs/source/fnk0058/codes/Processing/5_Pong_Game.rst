We have experienced single-player game snake before. Now, let's use Raspberry Pi Pico to play classic two-player pong game. You will experience both 2D and 3D version.

Project 5.1 Pong Game
********************************

First, let's experience the 2D version game.

.. note::
    
    :red:`To help users have a better experience when doing the projects, we have made some modifications to Picoâ€™s simulation diagram. Please note that there are certain differences between the simulation diagram and the actual board to avoid misunderstanding. Thanks for your support to our product.`

Sketch
=============================

Sketch Pong_Game
-------------------------------

Use Processing to open Pong_Game and click Run. If the connection succeeds, it will show as follows:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/5_Pong_Game/Chapter05_02.png
    :align: center

Now you can try to rotate the potentiometer to control the movement of paddle without ball. Press space bar

to start the game:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/5_Pong_Game/Chapter05_03.png
    :align: center

Use potentiometer to control the movement of paddle to block the ball back. The game rules are the same

as classic pong game:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/5_Pong_Game/Chapter05_04.png
    :align: center

The game will be over when one side reaches three points. Pressing the space bar can restart the game:

Additionally, you can restart the game by pressing the space bar at any time.

Project 5.2 Pong Game 3D
***************************

Now, let's experience the 3D version game.

Component List
============================

The same as last section.

Sketch Pong_Game_3D
==============================

Use Processing to open Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi_Pico\\Processing\\

Processing\\Pong_Game_3D\\Pong_Game_3D.pde and click Run. 

If the connection succeeds, it will show as follows:

Now you can try to rotate the potentiometer to control the movement of paddle without ball. Press space bar

to start the game:
